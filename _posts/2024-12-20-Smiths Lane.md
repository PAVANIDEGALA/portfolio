## My Role:

UI/UX Designer - For [Virtual Qube](https://www.vqubetech.com/)

## Project:

Smiths Lane Wines delivers premium quality wines from Australia and New Zealand, offering personalized bottle options

## Problem Statement:

Smiths Lane Wines, a family-owned wine business, aimed to improve its website’s user experience to better showcase its premium wine collection, personalization options, and promotional offers. The original design lacked a cohesive flow, making it difficult for users to navigate and engage with the brand effectively. A redesign was needed to create a seamless, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform to drive sales and build stronger connections with customers.

## Solution:

The redesigned Smiths Lane Wines website introduces a clean, modern, and inviting interface that celebrates the brand’s commitment to quality and family values. The key enhancements include:
- Feature Highlights and Promotions
- Streamlined Product Display
- Enhanced Personalization Options
- User-Centric Design
