* I'm Pavani, a UI/UX designer. Nice to meet you! 👋🏼


* Currently, I'm wrapping up my UI/UX design internship at ExamBazaar.I completed my Bachelor of Computer Science from Unity College. Before that, I also worked as a UI/UX Intern in a startup company. I look forward to starting a full-time role in graphic, UI/UX design.

* When I'm not designing:
  I watch anime, create digital art of my favourite characters, paint and learn how to code ✨
