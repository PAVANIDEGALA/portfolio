* I'm Pavani, UI/UX & Graphic designer. Nice to meet you! 👋🏼


* Currently, I'm working as a UI/UX Designer at Threewings Innovations. I bring three years of experience in designing user-friendly interfaces that inspire.

* When I'm not designing:
  I watch anime, create digital art of my favourite characters, paint and eat pizza ✨
