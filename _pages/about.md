*  Hi, I'm Pavani! 👋🏼
   
*  A UI/UX & Graphic Designer with 4 years of experience bringing ideas to life through seamless and engaging digital experiences.

*  I love creating intuitive interfaces, eye-catching visuals, and user-friendly designs that not only look great but also feel effortless to use.

*  Beyond design, I’m an artist — whether it's painting, creating digital art, or getting lost in anime (usually with a slice of pizza 🍕 in hand!). 

*  If you have a role to fill or have a chat , feel free to email me at pavanidegala123@gmail.com
