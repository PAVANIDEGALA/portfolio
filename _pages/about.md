* I'm Pavani, UI/UX & Graphic designer. Nice to meet you! 👋🏼


* Currently, I'm wrapping up my Graphic designer job at Marcamor Consultancy.I completed my Bachelor of Computer Science from Unity Degree College. Before that, I also worked as a UI/UX Intern at Exambazaar for 1 year.

* When I'm not designing:
  I watch anime, create digital art of my favourite characters, paint and eat pizza ✨
