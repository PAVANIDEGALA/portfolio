* I'm Pavani, a UI/UX designer with a zeal for the intersection of design and culture. Nice to meet you! 👋🏼


* Currently, I'm wrapping up my UI/UX design internship at ExamBazaar. I'm also a final year student at the Unity Degree College (Andhra University), majoring in Computer Science. Previously, I worked as a UI/UX designer at a startup company. I look forward to starting a full-time role in graphic, UI/UX design in the fall of 2023. If you have a role to fill, you know where to find me!
